Ruby Test Task
Time: 2h

Please create 2 models with at least the following attributes:
- Stock (name: string - must be unique)
- Bearer (name: string - must be unique)(can own many stocks)

Please create some JSON API endpoints:
1) Create a stock with a referenced bearer.
2) Update a stock. The bearer cannot be updated with this endpoint. If you need to change it, a new object needs to be created. If Bearer exists already, it must be re-used and connected to the stock.
3) List all stocks with information their Bearer.
4) Soft-delete a stock so it doesn't appear on the API.

Error responses should be detailed enough to see what exactly is missing or wrong.

Please don't hesitate to ask questions if anything is blocking you.
